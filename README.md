TIP: What is the difference between Roadmap and Strategy?

**Strategy** explains the approach you will take to realize that future state. And a roadmap is the more tactical plan for what you will do to get there (and when you will arrive), informed by the vision and strategy. Now, some people use the words “vision” and “strategy” interchangeably.
